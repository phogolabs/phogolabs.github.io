## Parcello

Parcello is a simple resource manager for Golang that allows embedding assets
like SQL, HTML, CSS, Icons, and Images. That allows easy release management by
deploying just a single binary rather than many files. It facilitates working
with resources by providing a command line interface as well as package to
manage the resources in your application. It has an Open Source license and
it’s completely maintained by us.

If you want to read more details about it, you can visit the official
